audiovisual-researcher
======================

AVResearcher, a prototype aimed at allowing media researchers to explore metadata associated with large numbers of audiovisual broadcasts. It allows them to compare and contrast the characteristics of search results for two topics, across time and in terms of content. Broadcasts can be searched and compared not only on the basis of traditional catalog descriptions, but also in terms of spoken content (subtitles), and social chatter (tweets associated with broadcasts). AVResearcher is a new and ongoing valorisation project at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.
