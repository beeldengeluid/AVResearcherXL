          Vision: the television and radio catalogue of public broadcasters
          from 1900 until November 2013. The iMMix collection exists of
          programme descriptions. From 2010 onwards, some tv programme
          descriptions are enriched with subtitles and tweets about the tv
          programmes. Moreover, for a few radio broadcasts, we also generated
          speech recognition files (early February 2012 until January
          2014).</p>

      <h2>Search</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>In the search box you can enter your query, i.e. any word or word
        combination (in Dutch). The interface will retrieve all documents that
        contain this word or word combination. The default setting for word
        combinations is AND. For instance, when typing Poolse migrant, the
        interface searches for every document that contains both words. See
        table at the right for an overview of all possible search strings (OR,
        NOT, etc). Stopwords such as ‘de’, ‘een’ etc are removed from the
        index.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your search can be specified by indicating in which field (<i
              class="fa fa-tags"></i>) of the document you want to search. For
        iMMix, the fields are:
      <ul>
        <li>iMMix program titles: title of radio or television programme.
          Often, they have more than one title (title of programme, title of
          episode etc). In that case, the interface searches in both titles.
        </li>
        <li>iMMix program descriptions: extensive description provided by
          professional annotators
        </li>
        <li>iMMix T888: subtitles for the hearing impaired, sparsely from 1982
          onwards, more from 2006 onwards and structural from 13 november 2012
          onwards
        </li>
        <li>iMMix tweets: collection of tweets about Dutch television
          programmes, 2012 until 2013. Tweets are collected on the basis of a
          ‘media list’: hashtags of television programmes and channels such as
          #DWDD or #NOS
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For KB, the fields are:

        <li>title: title of the article</li>
        <li>text: text of article</li>

        the range of broadcasting date, resp. publication date of all documents
        that match your query. The left date indicates the first document; the
        right date the most recent one. The time sliders can be moved/narrowed

      <h2>Word clouds</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>AVResearcherXL provides visualizations to support exploration of your
        query. It contains: word clouds, barcharts and a timeline. The word
        clouds, barcharts and the timeline are calculated by means of so-called
        ‘facets’. A facet is a characteristic of a certain collection. Each
        collection has different facets.</p>

      <p>
        The facets of iMMix are:
      <ol>
        <li>word: most descriptive terms generated by algorithms</li>
        <li>tag: keywords provided by the annotators of the iMMix catalogue
        </li>
        <li>channel: broadcasters</li>
        <li>people: persons provided by the annotators of the iMMix catalogue
        </li>
        <li>genre: genres provided by the annotators of the iMMix catalogue
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The facets of KB are:
      <ol>
        <li>word: most descriptive terms generated by algorithms</li>
        <li>source: title of the newspaper</li>
        <li>type: article, advertisement, family announcement, illustration
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>The ‘most descriptive terms’ are generated as follows: all punctuation
        marks are removed, all capital letters are removed (which means that
        differences in meaning between words with capital and without capital
        are also erased). It displays the most unique words for each document.
        This method implies that words which contain spelling-mistakes (such as
        OCR-mistakes in the newspaper scans or speech-recognition mistakes in
        the subtitles) will often be considered as unique for the document and,
        hence, might appear in the word cloud.</p>

      <p>The word cloud also functions as filter for your query. Once you
        select a term in the wordcloud, the term will be added to your query.
        For example if you select NOS in the word cloud of the facet ‘channel’,
        the interface shows only the radio and television broadcasts of the
        channel NOS. Excluding a term from the word cloud can be done by means
        of boolean operators in the search box. For instance when typing Pools
        -voetbal -wielrennen, the interface will search for documents that
        contain the word Pools, but exclude the words voetbal and
        wielrennen.</p>

  <div class="row subject">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Bar charts</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>The bar charts contain the same information as the word clouds, but in
        bars. They rank the highest frequencies per hit, from high to low
        numbers, hence enabling to compare the left and right query in a more
        structured way. In contrast to the word clouds, words in the bar charts
        are not clickable, neither function as filters.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row subject">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Time line</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>The timeline visualizes the amount of documents which contains your
        query. The blue line visualizes the frequency of the left query, and
        the red line this of the right query. “1” means one document (=one
        television programme or one newspaper article). In order to understand
        how the time line is generated, mouse-overs indicate what the numbers
        mean.</p>

      <p>When clicking on a ‘dot’, you can view the result list of the selected
        year/month/week/day in a pop-up window. </p>

      <p>There is no equal distribution of television, radio broadcasts and
        newspapers over time. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a lot of
        television and radio programme information is missing, too. Since the
        number of television programmes and newspaper varies over time, we
        implemented a normalization option for the timeline (<img
                src="/static/img/relative_s.png">). These relative frequencies
        (percentages) are calculated by dividing the number of documents with
        hits by the total number of documents within one year (or week, day,
        depending of the ‘bucket’). The normalization helps to compare result
        lists of different collections and different selected fields.</p>

  <div class="row subject">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Results list</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>The result lists show all documents that match your query. To paginate
        the documents, you can click on the page numbers at the bottom of the
        webpage.</p>

      <p>A first sorting option is relevancy (<img
              src="/static/img/sort-relevance_s.png">). Relevancy is calculated
        according to standard information retrieval techniques and algorithms.
        An other sort option for the result list is date, ascending (<img
                src="/static/img/sort-time-asc_s.png">) or descending (<img
                src="/static/img/sort-time-desc_s.png">).</p>

      <p>For each document, snippets of the selected fields are displayed for
        the iMMix-collection. For the KB-collection, we do not show any
        snippets as newspaper texts are protected by copyrights of the
        journalist(s) who wrote the article. The documents open within the
        respective search systems of
        <a href="http://in.beeldengeluid.nl">Sound and Vision</a>
        and KB’s <a href="http://delpher.nl">Delpher</a>,
        which contain all relevant information and
        -for the KB- also a scan of the original newspaper article. The website
        in.beeldengeluid.nl does not contain the full text subtitles due to
        copyright restrictions.</p>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>AVResearcherXL is a prototype and is continuously under development.
        If you have any suggestions for improvement or feedback, please contact
        Eva Baaren (<a href="mailto:ebaaren@beeldengeluid.nl">ebaaren@beeldengeluid.nl</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        We have already some ideas for extensions, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>integration with an overarching user management system, enabling to
          track search history, bookmark, export and save results
        </li>
        <li>additional and removable search boxes</li>
        <li>adding more collections, e.g. radio broadcasts</li>
        <li>icons instead of text for fields</li>
        <li>link to portal Academia.nl, providing access to streamed video
          material
        </li>
        <li>more precise facets for iMMix (e.g. radio is now determined by a
          mention of #radio in the title; iMMix contains movies, which are not
          filterable with the current interface)
        </li>
        <li>automatic updates of data through ‘live’ connection with iMMix and
          KB
        </li>
        <li>highlight queries in iMMix-catalogue and KB</li>
        <li>add more facets KB collection: persons, events etc</li>
        <li>add more subtitles</li>
